### About Me

2 years ago I started my career as a Software Testing Engineer. The tech world seized me so much that I decided to dive deeper into it. I finished "JS for Testing Engineers" course at EPAM. I decided to try myself and go inside so I took this course. And I feel that it could become my calling.
