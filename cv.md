### About Me

I started my IT career as a Software Testing Engineer 2 years ago. My first project involved the interaction with IoT devices. And as I'm a huge fan of Smart Home concept, it grabbed my full attention. I felt that this sphere resonates with me. The only open question was wether I'd like to keep on being a tester or to try something new within this field. I decided to keep on learning and gain more technical knowledge. As a result, I chose JS for studying and it's getting more and more exciting for me from day to day.

### Skills

* Functional Testing
* JavaScript
* Git
* HTML/CSS

### Code Example

```
function secondsOfDay() {

}

secondsOfDay();
```
