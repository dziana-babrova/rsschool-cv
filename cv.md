### About Me

2 years ago I started my career as a Software Testing Engineer. The tech world seized me so much that I decided to dive deeper into it. I finished "JS for Testing Engineers" course at EPAM. I decided to try myself and go inside so I took this course. And I feel that it could become my calling.

### Skills

* Functional Testing
* JavaScript
* Git

### Code Example

```
function secondsOfDay() {
    let today = new Date();
    let time = today.getHours() * 3600 + today.getMinutes() * 60 + today.getSeconds();
    return time;
}

secondsOfDay();
```
